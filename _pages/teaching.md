## Business Principles for the HRIR Professional (HRIR 6001)

This is a first-semester core course for Master of Human Resources & Industrial Relations students at the Carlson school. I taught two sessions in Fall 2022 to full- and part-time students. I received a PhD Student Teaching Award from the Carlson school for teaching this course.
