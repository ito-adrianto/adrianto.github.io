Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. My research program focuses on the consequences of technology adoption and employee ownership on work organization and employee well-being. It is particularly relevant in today's rapidly changing technological landscape. For centuries, technology adoption has caused anxiety for those whose jobs are close substitutes to the new machines. The fear of new technology persists today as the disparity in income and wealth between capital owners and workers widens. Addressing this issue involves treating workers as firm owners, allowing them to benefit from technological investments through capital ownership stakes. Evidence suggests that firms with broad-based employee ownership can reduce wealth concentration and redistribute wealth and income to the workers. Importantly, this does not harm the firm, as it has been shown in multiple studies that employee ownership is positively related to firm performance and survival. This research stream, therefore, offers hope for a future where technology and firm ownership can improve employee well-being. Despite the extensive literature on technology adoption and employee ownership, there is limited evidence on how sharing ownership with employees affects workplace outcomes in firms with varying degrees of automation. My research explores how the adoption of technology and employee ownership influences key measures of the organization of work and employee well-being, such as employment, skill requirements, compensation, job satisfaction, work-life balance, or mental and physical health.
