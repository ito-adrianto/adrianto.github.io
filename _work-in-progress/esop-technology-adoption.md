title: "The Introduction of Various Forms of Automation in the U.S. ESOP and Conventional Firms"
excerpt: "Co-authored with Avner Ben-Ner\n\nTechnological change has driven increased automation in all stages of the value chain, from logistics, to design, material processing, assembly, quality control, delivery, customer service, and everything in between. The forms of automation vary: (a) fixed hard automation (e.g., assembly lines), (b) programmable automation (CNC machines), (c) industrial robots, (d) flexible soft automation (e.g., modern manufacturing cells, smart assembly systems), (e) software automation (e.g., robotic process automation, automated testing), and (f) cognitive automation (e.g., natural language processing, integrated document processing). All forms of automation affect the demand for workers with different skillsets. Some forms of automation substitute for work done typically by low-skilled workers but require complementary work of high-skill workers, whereas other forms may reduce the demand for high-skill workers, and so on. What do ESOP firms, where employees influence company decisions and benefit from them more than their conventional counterparts, choose regarding different types of automation?\n\nBy granting ownership to workers, ESOP allows the potential to gain a slice of future profits and aligns the interests of both parties (employee-owners and other shareholders). Employees are also provided a representation of their voice through an ESOP trustee and committee. Thus, the adoption of technologies that advance worker well-being, such as employment stability, workplace safety, job satisfaction, and financial results, will likely be chosen. Therefore, the adoption of technologies by such firms is likely to be different than other firms.\n\nThe paper compares the adoption of these forms of automation by ESOP and conventional firms in the following industries: (1) professional services, (2) manufacturing, (3) construction, (4) finance, insurance and real estate, and wholesale and retail trade. There are approximately 6,000 ESOPs in these industries. These industries employ about half of the US civilian workforce and produce nearly half of the GDP.\n\nUsing job postings in the US economy 2010-2022, we examine the adoption of six forms of automation in all identified ESOPs and a sample of conventional firms matched by 3-digit NAICS industry and commuting zones. The analysis is at the firm and establishment levels. We compare the adoption levels in two periods, 2010-2012 and 2020-2022."
